When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In case of multiple machines or multiple people working on the repositories. In case of computer crashes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe someone else made a change that you donâ€™t want on your machine. Maybe the internet speed is very slow so better not to pull a change unless necessary.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork only takes place on git, between two users. You would use this if you want to make some modifications to a project with affecting the owner, but still giving credit to the owner. Clones are when you take a copy to the local machine for editing. Branches are starting from the same commit within a single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally might be in case you want to scrap all the changes you made and go back that state. Or you can compare all the changes made locally vs. the last version on the remote using diff.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
